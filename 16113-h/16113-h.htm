<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>The favourite reading of the Sultan of <font class="sc">Turkey</font>
  is said to be criminal literature. A gift-book in the shape of a new Life
  of the <font class="sc">Kaiser</font> is about to be despatched to
  him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<font class="sc">King Alexander</font> of Greece originally
proclaimed that he would "carry
out his father's sacred mandate." But
when it was pointed out to
him that, if this was really his
desire, an opportunity of following
in his father's footsteps
would doubtless be granted
him, he tried again.

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During the last air raid we are told that the employees of one large
  firm started singing "Dixie Land." We feel, however, that to combat the
  enemy's aircraft much sterner measures must be adopted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The Huns' diet is low," says a correspondent of <i>The Daily
  Mail</i>. But then their tastes are low too.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Writing of the recent Trentino offensive, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Hamilton Fyfe</font> says that several Austrian forts captured
  by the Italians were built of solid ice. It is time that London had some
  defences of this character.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The arrival of ex-<font class="sc">King Tino</font> at Lugubrioso, on
  the Swiss-Italian frontier, has been duly noted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The <font class="sc">Lord Mayor</font> of London has decided in future
  to warn the City of impending air raids. Ringing the dinner-bell at the
  Mansion House, it is thought, is the best way of making City men take to
  their covers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A new epidemic, of which "bodily swellings" are the first symptom, is
  reported by the German papers. And just when the previous epidemic of
  head-swellings was beginning to subside.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Marylebone boy, arrested for forgery, told the police that he had
  made two complete £1 notes out of paper bags. Is this the paper-bag
  cookery of which we have heard so much?</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A market gardener told the Enfield Tribunal that a conscientious
  objector whom he had employed was found asleep at his work on two
  successive days. People with highly-strung consciences very rarely enjoy
  this natural and easy slumber.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The American scientist who claims to have invented a substitute for
  tobacco cannot have followed the movement of the age. We have been able
  to obtain twopenny cigars in this country for years.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An applicant who said he had six children has been given six months'
  exemption. A member of the Tribunal remarked that the exemption would
  mean one month for each child. This great discovery proved too much for
  the poor fellow, who is said to have collapsed immediately.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A new ship is being fitted out for Captain <font
  class="sc">Amundsen</font>, who is to proceed shortly with an Arctic
  exploration party. In case he should discover any new land, arrangements
  have been made to hold a flag-day for the inhabitants, if any.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Judging by the latest reports the Stockholm Conference is like the gun
  that they didn't know was loaded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Because his wife accused him of not loving her, a farmer of Husavik,
  Manitoba, assaulted her with a pen-knife just to show that he did.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Special "storm troops"&mdash;men picked for their youth, vigour and
  daring, to carry out counter-attacks&mdash;are now a feature of the
  German Armies. Even our ordinary British soldiers, who are constantly
  compelled to take these brave fellows prisoners, bear witness to the
  ferocity of their appearance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Taxes on watering-places, it is announced, will be a feature of the
  new French Budget. It is feared that this will bear hardly on breweries
  and dairies.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are not permitted to publish the name of the Foreign Office
  official who strolled into a Piccadilly Bar last week and ordered a
  Clam-Martinic cocktail.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a report of the National Physical Laboratory the Tower of
  London is moving towards the Thames. The hot weather is thought to have
  something to do with it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Board of Agriculture advises the killing of all old cocks and
  hens. Lively competition between the railway refreshment rooms and the
  tyre factories should ensure a satisfactory price.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The High Court at the Hague has ordered a new trial in the case of the
  Editor of the <i>Telegraaf</i>, who was sentenced for referring to "a
  group of rascals in the centre of Europe." The rascality of the persons
  in question is now deemed to be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The announcement that there will be no more Sunday music at the Zoo
  has been received with satisfaction by the more conservative residents,
  who have always complained that the presence of a band tended to reduce
  the place to the level of a mere circus.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A well-known inn at Effingham having changed its name from the Blücher
  to the Sir Douglas Haig, it is further suggested that the name of the
  village should be changed to Biffingham.</p>

<h4>How to Cure a Wound.</h4>

  <p>"A wounded soldier jumped or fell from a passing S.E.R. Red Cross
  train between Swanley Junction and Bromley to-day. The train was running
  at about twenty miles an hour. When picked up the man was found to be
  uninjured."&mdash;<i>Evening Paper.</i></p>

<h3>TITLE AND HALF-TITLE PAGES.</h3>

  <p>With a view to economy of paper, the title and half-title pages of the
  Volume which is completed with the present issue are not being delivered
  with copies of <i>Punch</i> as hitherto; they will however be sent free,
  by post, upon receipt of a request.</p>

  <p>Those readers who have their Volumes bound at the <i>Punch</i> Office,
  or by other binders in the official binding-cases, will not need to apply
  for copies of the title and half-title pages, as these will be bound in
  by the <i>Punch</i> Office or supplied direct to other binders along with
  the cases.</p>

<hr />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span>

<h3>ALGY.</h3>

  <p>Algy, it must be admitted, is no Adonis, but at least there is
  something in his great round pudding-face and his cheery idiotic smile
  which gives one the impression of a warm and optimistic nature.</p>

  <p>Algy is humble and not ambitious; but for all that he is doing his
  bit, just as you and I are doing. He never goes on strike, and if he had
  any money, which he never does have, I know he would invest it in War
  Loan. Above all he is not a food-hog; not for him the forbidden potato or
  the millionaire's beer&mdash;no! Against all luxuries Algy has resolutely
  steeled his voluminous tummy. He has turned into the strictest of
  teetotalers, and, though a glass of Scotch may bring a wistful look into
  his eyes, yet he remains captain of his soul, unbroken as <font
  class="sc">St. Anthony</font>.</p>

  <p>His job is war-work of the steeliest order, such as very few men would
  care to undertake. All for the cause he stands, day after day, with a
  little band of comrades, facing uncomplainingly the most terrible
  buffetings, so that men may learn from him how to strike terror into the
  heart of the Hun.</p>

  <p>Needless to remark, he is beloved by all the Tommies who inflict such
  pain upon the region of his gaudy blue waistcoat; he never seems to care
  and never grouses, but beams down on them undaunted with that quaint old
  grin of his.</p>

  <p>'Twas a great and solemn day when we installed him. Conspicuous by his
  horrible suit of reach-me-downs, supported on one side by the
  sergeant-major, on the other by the sergeant, he was led gently but
  firmly out of his billet and initiated into his honourable task.</p>

  <p>Algy has but one grievance. He wants badly to sport a few golden
  stripes on his cuff. He is modest and does not push himself forward, but
  as he has several times been severely wounded be thinks it only fair that
  he should receive the coveted distinction. But the authorities will not
  grant his simple request because, they say, he has shed no blood.</p>

  <p>He has outlived all his compeers; lesser men may succumb but Algy goes
  on. One day, I suppose, he will meet the common fate; but may that sorry
  day be far ahead. For we could ill spare our Algy&mdash;our dear old
  bayonet dummy!</p>

<hr />

  <blockquote>
  <p>"INDIAN WAR LOAN.&mdash;The amount applied for in Rangoon yesterday
  was Rs. 00,000, making the progressive total Rs.
  00,00,000."&mdash;<i>Rangoon Times.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Nothing to boast about.</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE BAN ON RACING.</h3>

  <p>Dear <font class="sc">Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;In this bitter
  controversy I hope that a few moderate and impartial words from one, like
  myself, who sees clearly both sides of the question, may not be out of
  place. In any case I feel it is incumbent upon me to do all I can to
  avert the dire consequences of the frightful catastrophe that has fallen
  upon us through the mad act of an insensate War Cabinet. I can only say
  that if this is to be our spirit we are indeed defeated. Where is our
  devotion to manly sports, so potent in the moulding of our National
  character? What has become of our immemorial Right to Look On? Where is
  our boasted liberty, deprived as we are now to be of a chance to find the
  winner? What did <font class="sc">Wellington</font> say of Waterloo? and
  <font class="sc">Marlborough</font> of Blenheim? and <font
  class="sc">Bottomley</font> of the Battle of the Somme? By what
  perversity of reasoning are we thus to asphyxiate the best instincts of
  our race?</p>

  <p>We are said to be fighting for all that we hold sacred. Yet there is
  nothing that is held more sacred in every cottage home throughout the
  land than the Preservation of our Bloodstock. Let us not deceive
  ourselves. It is our supremacy in Bloodstock alone that makes possible
  the governess car, the milk van, the brewer's dray, the very plough
  itself. These are fundamental facts.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that, in order to avoid the assembling of
  frivolous crowds in war-time, races might be run in private. But that is
  quite impracticable. Only on the public racecourse can the lofty virtues
  of our British Bloodstock be displayed. The exciting presence of the
  crowd is absolutely essential to tune up its nerve and temper. Already
  our Bloodstock has suffered cruelly from gaps in the Grand Stand.</p>

  <p>Then again there are some who actually complain that petrol is
  consumed in large quantities by those attending race meetings. Are we to
  put new heart into our enemies by letting it be known that we are short
  of petrol?</p>

  <p>And finally there are some who so little understand the qualities of
  the Thoroughbred as to suggest that gambling should be stopped in
  war-time. The horse, unlike the Cabinet, is intelligent. Can he be
  expected to exhibit his priceless qualities of speed and stamina if no
  one puts his money up?</p>

  <p>I need say no more. Such flippant legislation is bad enough at any
  time; during the Armageddon period it is little short of treason. One
  wonders when our Government will begin to realise that we are at war.</p>

<h3>THE DIARY OF A CO-ORDINATOR.</h3>

  <p><i>June 17th.</i>&mdash;Flew in an aeroplane to Los Angeles and
  correlated the industrial functions of the East and West. Returned to the
  White House for dinner, and co-ordinated grape juice with lemonade and
  Perrier.</p>

  <p><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted with <font
  class="sc">Hearst</font> and co-ordinated him for half-an-hour with the
  editor of <i>New York Life</i>, a task needing the highest diplomatic
  qualities. Flew to Harvard and delivered lecture on Mr. <font
  class="sc">Balfour's</font> Theology as correlated with his style in
  golf. A great reception. Despatched report by wireless to London, Paris
  and Petrograd. Returned to New York in the afternoon and co-ordinated
  <font class="sc">Upton Sinclair</font>, Colonel <font
  class="sc">Roosevelt</font>, <font class="sc">Tumulty</font> and <font
  class="sc">Charles Dana Gibson</font>.</p>

  <p><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;In the morning dictated articles for the
  <i>Novoe Vremya</i>, <i>Matin</i> and <i>Corriere della Sera</i>,
  emphasizing the need of co-operative cosmopolitan co-ordination. Flew to
  Chicago to deliver supplementary lecture to that given by <font
  class="sc">Arthur Balfour</font> on <font class="sc">Aristotle</font>.
  Took for my subject "Aerial Trade Routes, as co-ordinated with
  Terra-firma Routes for Motor-lorries." Enthusiastic reception.
  Co-ordinative cold collation at 9 <font class="sc">p.m.</font> at
  Philadelphia with <font class="sc">Gompers</font>, <font
  class="sc">Rockefeller</font>, Mrs. <font class="sc">Atherton</font> and
  <font class="sc">Billy Sunday</font>.</p>

  <p><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;Dictated article on the New Diplomacy for
  <i>The New York Journal</i>. In the afternoon co-ordinated the tenets of
  Shin-Toism, Christian Science and Mormonism. A heavy day.</p>

  <p><i>June 21st.</i>&mdash;Much annoyed by report of <font
  class="sc">Curzon's</font> extraordinary speech in the House of Lords.
  Called at the White House and the British Embassy to put matters right,
  and sent wireless to <font class="sc">Curzon</font>: "Nothing 'succeeds'
  like success."</p>

<h2>JUST SAILORS.</h2>

  <p>Betty, having made an excellent breakfast, thank you, slipped from her
  chair and sidled round the table to me. Her father's guests are,
  naturally and without exception, Betty's slaves, to do with as she deems
  best. To her they are known, regardless of age, either by their Christian
  names or as "Mr. &mdash;er." I had enjoyed the privilege of her
  acquaintance for five years, but was still included in the second
  category.</p>

  <p>Betty has an appealing eye, freckles, and most fascinating red-gold
  hair, and on the morning of which I write, after preparing the attack
  with the first, she gently massaged my face with the second and third,
  the while insinuating into my own a small hand not innocent of marmalade.
  Betty is seven or thereabouts. "Mr. &mdash;er," she said, "what shall we
  be to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Let us," I replied hastily, "pretend to be not quite at our best this
  morning, and have a quiet time in the deck-chairs on the lawn." Betty
  very naturally paid no regard whatever to this cowardly suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure," she said, "if we will be pirates or soldiers or
  just sailors. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Pirates sounded rather strenuous for so hot a day. Soldiers, I felt
  sure, involved my becoming a German prisoner and parading the garden
  paths with my arms up, crying "Kamerad!" while Betty, gun in hand,
  shepherded and prodded me from behind. Just sailors, on the other hand,
  smacked of gentle sculling exercise in the dinghy on the lake, so I said,
  "Let's be just sailors."</p>

  <p>But a sailor's life, as interpreted by Betty, is no rest cure. On land
  it includes an exaggerated rolling gait&mdash;itself somewhat
  fatiguing&mdash;and intervals of active participation in that most
  exacting dance, the hornpipe, to one's own whistling accompaniment. At
  odd moments, also, it appears that the best sailors double briskly to
  such melodies as "Tipperary" and "Keep the Home Fires Burning."</p>

  <p>It was only when we arrived by the lake-side that Betty observed my
  gumboots; instantly a return to the house in search of Daddy's nautical
  footgear was necessitated. This, though generous in dimensions, was
  finally induced to remain in position on Betty's small feet, her own
  boots being, of course, retained.</p>

  <p>The dinghy was launched and, after a little preliminary wading in the
  gum-boots, the crew embarked. Betty's future profession will, I am sure,
  be that of quick-change artist. In less than ten minutes she had risen
  from cabin-boy to skipper, <i>viâ</i> ordinary seaman, A.B., bo'sun and
  various grades of mate. My rank, which had at the outset been that of
  admiral, as speedily declined, until I was merely the donkey-engine
  greaser, whose duties appeared to include that of helmsman (Betty is not
  yet an adept with two sculls).</p>

  <p>Our vessel also changed its character with lightning rapidity. It was
  in turn a ferry-boat&mdash;imitation of passengers descending the gangway
  by rhythmical patting of hand on thwart; a hospital ship chased by a
  submarine&mdash;cormorant's neck and head naturally mistaken for
  periscope; a destroyer attacking a submarine&mdash;said cormorant kindly
  obliging with quick diving act when approached; a food-ship laden with
  bananas represented by rushes culled from the banks; and a smuggler
  running cargoes of French wine contained in an elderly empty bottle
  discovered in the mud above high-water mark. It was breathless work.</p>

  <p>The disaster occurred when Betty, against my maturer judgment,
  insisted upon the exploration on foot of a mangrove swamp on the shore of
  a cannibal-infested South Sea island. The immediate cause was a suddenly
  developed attachment on the part of one of Daddy's sea-boots to the mud
  on the lake-side. The twain refused to be parted, and the youthful
  explorer measured her length in the mire.</p>

  <p>Generously overlooking my carelessness in not warning her that we were
  traversing a quicksand, Betty, rather shaken, very muddy and with a
  suspicion of tears in her voice, bound me by a blood-curdling nautical
  oath not to breathe a word of the mishap to <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page413" id="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span> Mummy, Daddy or Miss
  Watt, her governess. The pledge having been given, Betty, the offending
  boots discarded, fled to her own room by way of the back-door.</p>

  <p>It was then twelve o'clock, and in the hour that remained before
  luncheon I was fertile in excuses for Betty's absence from the scene; in
  fact, the necessity for concealing the calamity quite marred what should
  have been a time of well-earned relaxation.</p>

  <p>At last we sat down to the midday meal, and the members of the
  house-party began to relate their morning's adventures. Finally some
  thoughtless person said, "Well, Betty, and what mischief have you been up
  to?"</p>

  <p>Betty, quite recovered and with a radiant smile, replied, "Oh, Mr.
  &mdash;er and I had a scrumptious time on the lake. We were
  sailors&mdash;just sailors&mdash;and did all sorts of lovely things,
  didn't we, Mr. &mdash;er?"</p>

  <p>I agreed, and Betty went on to her peroration:</p>

  <p>"And at the very end Mr. &mdash;er was a tiger and I was a little
  small boy, and he jumped on me out of the bushes and knocked me down in
  the mud" [O Betty! O unjust sailor!], "and Miss Watt came in as I was
  changing my things. It <i>was</i> splendid, wasn't it&mdash;Reggie?"</p>

  <p><i>Per ardua ad astra.</i> I had won my promotion to the commissioned
  ranks of the Christian names.</p>

<h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>(<i>Herr Schultze and Herr Müller, privates in a Prussian regiment of
  Infantry.</i>)</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Leave will soon be over now and we shall have to go
  back to the fighting.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> Yes; it is not a very cheerful prospect.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> No; that is a very true saying. And, what is more,
  there seems no possible end to this War, though (<i>dropping his voice
  and looking round</i>) we all hate it from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> Yes, we all hate it. Indeed the hatred between me and
  the War gets worse and worse every day. I don't care who hears me.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Don't be too bold; one never knows who may be
  listening.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> It is to become mad. Why did we ever let the <font
  class="sc">All-Highest Majesty</font> begin such a war? We were all so
  comfortable, and then suddenly the Austrian <font
  class="sc">Archduke</font> gets himself murdered and, piff-paff, we
  Germans must go to war against Russia and France and England. I am very
  sorry for the <font class="sc">Archduke</font>, but there were other
  Archdukes to supply his place, and even if there had not been I do not
  think he himself was worth the four millions of killed, wounded and
  prisoners whom we have lost since the guns began to go off.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> It is terrible to think of. And the sausages get
  worse and worse, and the beer costs more and more and is not like beer at
  all.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> And the English have good guns and plenty of them, and
  know colossally well how to use them; and they have millions of
  men&mdash;more than we have; and their soldiers are brave&mdash;almost as
  brave as our own soldiers. They have certainly won some victories, it
  seems.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> So it seems; but our Generals have not told us much
  about it.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> And we all thought they had only a contemptible little
  army.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Yes, that was what the <font
  class="sc">All-Highest</font> said.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> The <font class="sc">All-Highest</font> has also said
  several times that our soldiers would be back in their homes before the
  leaves fell from the trees, and here are you and I doomed to go away from
  our homes in the third year of the war. It would be better, I think, if
  the <font class="sc">All-Highest</font> did not always speak so much and
  tried honestly to bring us a good solid peace.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze</i> (<i>with a deep sigh</i>). Peace? I do not think we
  shall ever have peace again. And the winning of victories seems to push
  it always further away from us. At that rate what is the use of
  victories?</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> Then you don't believe that the U-boats can starve
  England into surrender?</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Certainly I don't. Do you know anyone that does
  believe in that fairy story? All that the U-boats have really effected up
  to the present has been to bring in America on the side of our
  enemies.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> That doesn't matter. The Americans have no army.</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Wasn't that what we said about the English? You
  yourself said it as loudly as anyone else at the beginning.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> The fact is this War has gone on too long. A war for
  six weeks, that one can endure; but when it goes on for years&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> Yes, that is not so pleasant, though the <font
  class="sc">Kaiser</font> is always talking about hacking through and
  having an iron fist and being a wall of steel and other things of that
  sort.</p>

  <p><i>Müller.</i> Oh, he! I'm tired to death of his speeches and his
  prancing about. Again I say I don't care who hears me. We have done
  enough for glory; isn't there something we can do for peace?</p>

  <p><i>Schultze.</i> No, nothing&mdash;and you know it. It is more likely
  we shall end in prison if we talk like this.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

<p class="center">LXII.</p>

<font class="sc">My dear Charles</font>,&mdash;I've become so
artful these days in disguising identities
under assumed names that I'm
hanged if I can remember myself which
of my people is which. Still I daresay
your own memory isn't too good, so
we'll call him Ross this time, and trust
to luck that that is what we called him
last time. He is that one of my friends
and fellow sinners who was plugging
along nicely at the Bar in 1914, and
was just about to take silk, when he
changed his mind, came to France and
got mixed up in what he calls "this
vulgar brawl on the Continent." After
nearly three years of systematic warfare
in the second line he has at last
achieved the rank of full lieutenant,
which is not so bad for a growing lad
of forty-five; and is running one of
those complicated but fascinating side-shows
which, to oblige Their Exigencies,
we have to label Queer Trades,
and leave at that.

  <p>Whether his department is or is not making history it is certainly one
  which calls for a vast amount of special knowledge in its
  <i>personnel</i>. Ross, having been at the Bar, knows nothing and knows
  that he knows nothing, but is able to pretend to know just enough to keep
  his end up with Thos. J. Brown, who, disguised as a corporal, really runs
  the business. "Our Mr. Brown," as Ross calls him, is one of those nice
  old gentlemen who wear large spectacles and cultivate specialist
  knowledge on the intensive system. Owing to his infallibility in all
  details and upon all occasions he was much sought after in peace time by
  the larger commercial houses. When War broke out our Mr. Brown disdained
  peace. He made at once for the Front; but his aged legs, though encased
  in quite the most remarkable puttees in France, were found to be less
  reliable than his head, and he was held up on his way to the trenches and
  diverted to the stool of Ross's office.</p>

  <p>He began by putting some searching and dreadfully intelligent
  questions to Ross; dissatisfied with Ross's answers, he concentrated his
  mind on the business for twenty-four consecutive hours, at the end of
  which period he was the master of it in more senses than one. Since that
  time Ross has ensured the efficient running of his office by keeping out
  of it when it is busy. When for appearance sake he has to be there he
  does as his Mr. Brown tells him, and never wastes the latter's time by
  arguing.</p>

  <p>In the Army, all fleas have bigger fleas upon their backs to bite 'em.
  Were this not so somebody would have to act upon his own responsibility,
  and that, as you will admit, would make war an impossibility. Accordingly
  in every department there is a series of authorities, starting with
  "other ranks" at the bottom, proceeding in an ascending scale of dignity
  and worth, and disappearing through a cloud of Generals into an infinite
  of which no man knoweth the nature. Thus, with Ross's business (to take
  the tail end of it) the letter which the Corporal writes the Lieutenant
  signs on behalf of the Major. It is when the Major wants to do something
  more active that trouble arises. Let us take an incidental matter of
  administrative detail for example, setting it forth, as all military
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[pg 416]</span>
  matters should be set forth, in paragraphs, separately
  numbered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Lt. Ross possessed a bicycle, motor, one. No. 54321 L/Cpl. Burt
  possessed feet, two, only. Ross had no occasion, ability or disposition
  to ride a motor bicycle. No. 54321 could neither do his business nor
  enjoy life afoot. Accordingly, No. 54321 rode the bicycle, while, for the
  purposes of what is known to better people than ourselves as
  Establishment, Ross owned it. But that was in the good old days, before
  Traffic and Police and all the Others interested themselves.</p>

  <p>2. The first thing Traffic did was to say that all owners of motor
  bicycles must own cards, and produce them when demanded. That was easy:
  No. 54321 got the card. Then Police issued some vague but menacing
  literature with regard to the fate of people who stole other people's
  property or failed to stick to their own. There was no difficulty about
  this; Ross publicly fathered the thing.</p>

  <p>3. Traffic, issuing new cards, said next that all owners of cards must
  also own bicycles. Realising the quandary, Ross was for saying he
  wouldn't play any more, but would declare a separate peace. His Mr. Brown
  however got up a long and intricate correspondence, at the end of which
  Ross was still owner and No. 54321 was still rider; both had cards, and
  all the authorities had, unknowingly, made themselves parties to the
  fraud.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Major declared his intention of putting the whole of
  Ross's establishment (including bicycle) on what he called a satisfactory
  basis by a series of orders which he proposed to draft himself. Ross,
  always ready to be put on a satisfactory basis by anybody, took note of
  the draft, and laid it before his Mr. Brown. The latter was aghast, and
  proved, by infallible reasons, the fatal results which would follow if
  the matter was stirred up. Ross made a careful note of the reasons, and
  laid them before the Major. The Major explained gently that discipline
  was discipline. And so Ross went to and fro between the two, until the
  Major said, "Really, Ross!" and his Mr. Brown said, "I'm very sorry, Sir,
  but there it is;" and yet Ross couldn't sack his Major, and he couldn't
  break away from his Mr. Brown.</p>

  <p>He was between the Devil and the Deep Sea. What was he to do about it?
  Well, he just told the Deep Sea to keep calm a little longer, and went
  and waited outside the Devil's Mess. He saluted and asked the Devil if
  he'd care to come for a walk, and, the latter consenting, he led him to
  the Deep Sea. Then, when the Devil himself had been introduced to the
  Deep Sea itself, Ross slipped off and left them in his office to fix it
  up between themselves.</p>

  <p>Ross dined with the Major that night, and the latter said he wasn't
  feeling at all well. The way Ross's Mr. Brown had licked his thumb and
  the lightning speed with which he had turned up exactly the right
  correspondence, office minute or Routine Order, had nearly given the
  Major heart disease. Besides, he'd lost the argument. "I was too heavily
  handicapped from the start," said he, "by not being in a position to lick
  <i>my</i> thumb or to stick <i>my</i> pencil behind my ear."</p>

  <p>It was a good idea to introduce the Major and Mr. Brown, wasn't it,
  Charles? The Major says he was the first to suggest it, and Ross is
  careful to leave the credit with the Major, because he is sure that the
  idea really originated in the fertile and masterful brain of his Mr.
  Brown.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

  <p><i>Monday, June 18th.</i>&mdash;Arising out of the dethronement of
  <font class="sc">Tino</font> a cloud-burst of questions descended upon
  Lord <font class="sc">Robert Cecil</font>, who took refuge under a
  wide-spreading umbrella of official ignorance. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lynch</font> was annoyed because his question whether the
  Allies would oppose the foundation of a Greek Republic was dismissed as
  "hypothetical," but Lord <font class="sc">Robert</font> assured him that
  there was "nothing abusive" in the epithet. But is that so? Suppose he
  were to describe Mr. <font class="sc">Lynch</font> as a "hypothetical
  statesman"?</p>

  <p>A detailed history of a Canterbury lamb, from its purchase in New
  Zealand at 6&#x215C;<i>d.</i> a pound to its sale to the British butcher
  at 10½<i>d.</i>, was given by Mr. <font class="sc">George Roberts</font>.
  He threw no light, however, on the problem why it should double in price
  before reaching the consumer. This is engaging the anxious consideration
  of Lord <font class="sc">Rhondda</font>, who declares that there is no
  adequate economic reason why Little Mary should have only a little
  lamb.</p>

  <p>In the House of Commons as in a music-hall you can always get a laugh
  by referring to "the lodger." Whether the lodger, who is considered quite
  good enough to vote for a mere Member of Parliament, should also be
  allowed a voice in the election of really important people like town
  councillors was the theme of animated discussion. It ended ultimately in
  the lodger's favour, with the proviso that the apartments he occupies
  should be unfurnished. On such niceties does the British Constitution
  depend.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, June 19th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font>
  received a warm welcome from all sections of the House on making his
  first appearance after his return from America. Even the ranks of
  Tuscany, on the Irish benches, could not forbear to cheer their old
  opponent. Besides securing American gold for his country, he has
  transferred some American bronze to his own complexion, and has, if
  anything, sharpened his faculty for skilful evasion and polite repartee
  by his encounters with Transatlantic journalists.</p>

  <p>In the course of the daily catechism on the subject of air-raids Mr.
  <font class="sc">MacMaster</font> inquired, "Why is it that Paris appears
  to be practically immune, while London is not?" The answer came, not from
  the Front Bench, but from the Chair, and was delivered in a tone so low
  that even the Official Reporter failed to catch it. That is a pity,

  <p>In a perfectly free division, in which Ministers and ex-Ministers were
  mixed up together in both Lobbies, woman's right to be registered as a
  Parliamentary elector was affirmed by 385 votes to 55. Some capital
  speeches were made on both sides, but if any of them turned a vote it was
  probably the cynical admission of the <font
  class="sc">Attorney-General</font> that he was as much opposed to female
  suffrage as ever, but meant to vote for it because it was bound to come.
  This probably had an even greater effect upon the average Member, who is
  not an idealist, than the nutshell novelette in which Lord <font
  class="sc">Hugh Cecil</font> lightly outlined the possible future of the
  female politician.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, June 20th.</i>&mdash;Military metaphors come naturally
  to the Duke of <font class="sc">Marlborough</font>. Yet I cannot think he
  was happily inspired when, in reminding the farmers of their duty to put
  more land under the plough, he compared the compulsory powers of the
  Board of Agriculture to a sword in its scabbard, and hoped there would be
  no necessity to rattle it. Everybody knows that the sword in question is
  a converted ploughshare, and that it rests with the War Office to turn it
  back again.</p>

  <p>Last night fifty-five Members resisted Votes for Women. By this
  afternoon twenty-five of them had so far changed their minds as to
  protest against the limitation of the privilege to women over thirty.
  Major <font class="sc">Rowland Hunt</font>, convinced that women would
  soon vote themselves into the House, expressed a naïve preference for
  "young 'uns."</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, June 21st.</i>&mdash;During Sir <font class="sc">Edward
  Grey's</font> long tenure of the Foreign Secretaryship he rarely visited
  the House of Commons more than twice a week. Until his voyage to the
  United States, Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font> was even less
  attentive to his Parliamentary duties and left most of the
  "donkey-work"&mdash;if one may so describe the business of answering the
  questions of curious Members&mdash;to Lord <font class="sc">Robert
  Cecil</font>. Since his return Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font> has
  developed a new zest for this pastime, and to-day for the third time in
  succession appeared in his place. Everybody is pleased to see him there,
  except perhaps the curious Members aforesaid, who find him even more
  chary of information than his deputy. Had not the <font
  class="sc">President</font> of the United States said something about
  Alsace-Lorraine? ventured Corporal <font class="sc">Lees-Smith</font>.
  Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font>, fresh from the White House, blandly
  replied, "I do not propose to discuss President <font
  class="sc">Wilson's</font> Notes."</p>

  <p>The notion, prevalent at the beginning of the War, that every German
  waiter was an emissary of the <font class="sc">Kaiser</font>, only
  awaiting "The Day" when he should return to take a full revenge for
  meagre gratuities, still subsists in certain minds. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Brookes</font> was manifestly disappointed when Dr. <font
  class="sc">MacNamara</font> assured him that the aeronaut captured in the
  recent raid was not, as he supposed, one of these returned Ganymedes, but
  was making his first appearance on English soil.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Our moorland novelists are of two schools. One of them depicts the
  dwellers on these heights as a superior race, using a vocabulary half
  Biblical, half minor-poetic, in which to express the most exalted
  sentiments; the other draws a picture of upland domesticity comparable to
  that found in a cage of hyenas. Mr. <font class="sc">Halliwell
  Sutcliffe</font>, though he is too skilled an artist to overdo the
  colouring, inclines (I am bound to say) so much towards the former method
  that I confess to an uneasy doubt, at times, whether any human families
  could maintain existence on the same plane of nobility as, for example,
  the <i>Holts</i> in his latest romance, <i>Lonesome Heights</i> (<font
  class="sc">Ward, Lock</font>). These <i>Holts</i> were a race of
  farmer-squires, and in the book you see their development through two
  generations: the masterful old man and his twin sons. This is all the
  tale; a simple enough record, but full of the dignity and beauty which
  make the reading of any story by this author a refreshment to irritated
  nerves. Towards the end some space is devoted to the fight to abolish
  child-labour in the dale mills; there is also a scandal, and the
  fastening of blame upon the wrong brother; no very great matter. It is
  for such scenes as that of the death of old <i>Holt</i>, and his last
  words to the horse that has thrown him, that <i>Lonesome Heights</i> will
  earn its place on your library list.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Dice of the Gods</i> (<font class="sc">Heath, Cranton</font>)
  is not, as the title suggests, something rather thrilling in the way of
  romantic fiction, but one of those dispassionate novels in which the
  author, through the medium of his puppets, gently scourges the follies of
  society. <i>William van der Beck</i>, whose fictional house of clay very
  obviously clothes the spiritual essence of the author, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lucian de Zilwa</font>, returns to his native Colombo with a
  liberal education, to find that the life and thought of the strange
  Indo-European bourgeoisie to which he belongs by birth present no
  alluring features. In point of fact the ambitions and hypocrisies,
  pretences and prejudices of the Cingalese "burgher" with the tell-tale
  finger-nails are merely those of Bristol or Amsterdam evolved under
  Colonial conditions. <i>Jack van der Beck</i>, for example, the pompous
  medical ass with a flourishing practice among the local nabobs, can be
  found in every provincial town in Europe. <i>The Dice of the Gods</i> has
  no plot worthy of the name, but Mr. <font class="sc">de Zilwa</font> has
  both satire and philosophy at his command, and a flair for atmosphere.
  His scenery and "props" too will be new even to the most hardened
  novel-reader. He paints a vivid Oriental background with which the
  semi-Western civilization of his characters alternately blends and
  contrasts rather effectively.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Tresidder Sheppard's</font> <i>The Quest of
  Ledgar Dunstan</i> (<font class="sc">Duckworth</font>) is one of those
  half-sequels of which, while it remains true that You Can Start Here, you
  will get a better grip with some previous knowledge of the earlier story
  about the same people. Not that your hold upon the present book will,
  even then, be other than slightly precarious. For my own part I seldom
  met anything so elusive. I freely grant that it is original, thoughtful
  and provocative, but the effect it produces is rather like that of
  <i>Jaberwocky</i> upon <i>Alice</i> ("It fills me with ideas, only I
  don't know what they are!"). At first one seemed in for a comedy of
  disillusion. <i>Ledgar</i> and <i>Mary</i>, united, are met with in the
  process of living unhappily ever after. This is clear enough, human
  (unfortunately) and amusing. It was, for one thing, <i>Mary's</i> habit
  of misquotation that got upon <i>Ledgar's</i> nerves. "Alas, poor
  Garrick!" was one of her typical lapses. Nor was <i>Ledgar</i> himself
  more of a success with <i>Mary</i>, who found him (and here my sympathies
  went over to her) lacking in force and coherence. But as <i>Mary</i>
  eloped with somebody else at the end of part one she hadn't my prolonged
  experience of <i>Ledgar's</i> incomprehensibility. Nor did the question
  of his semi-lunatic friend worry her, or the whole problem of what, if
  anything, was the motive of the book. Eventually he is shown pairing off
  with his earlier love, <i>Winnie</i>; and I am bound to say that she too
  has my sympathy. I should sum up by saying that the analysis of
  introspective egotism, however subtly done, can make at best only an
  exasperating story.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In <i>By the Waters of Africa</i> (<font class="sc">Robert
  Scott</font>) Miss <font class="sc">Norma Lorimer</font> has described
  her British East African travels in a series of letters, in which she
  shows a very real sense of style and a delightful assumption of her own
  unimportance. To people suffering from the books of travellers who seem
  more anxious to air themselves than to give impressions of the countries
  through which they have passed, it will be a pure relief to find an
  author who suppresses herself and really gets on with her business.
  Thanks to her friends, whose kindness she frankly acknowledges, Miss
  <font class="sc">Lorimer</font> was able to see native life under
  conditions impossible to a less privileged traveller, and she misses no
  feature in it that is either humorous or enlightening. It is a model book
  of its kind, valuable up to a certain point and always pleasant to read.
  Some of the author's adventures might easily have excused a reckless use
  of notes of exclamation. But only once does she give way to this
  weakness, and this I pardon her, for I should always use one myself on
  the eve of starting for the Mountains of the Moon.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH IN RUSSIA.</h2>

  <p>In the last Epilogue, where Mr. Punch was described as paying a call
  upon our brave soldiers in a German prison-camp, I confessed that I
  didn't understand how he got there in the body. To-day I have to report a
  far simpler enterprise. This time he has merely been on a mission to
  Russia. Anybody can do that, unless the Sailors' and Firemen's Union
  mistake him for Mr. <font class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</font> and no one
  has yet made this error in respect of Mr. Punch.</p>

  <p>His brilliant mastery of the Russian language is a harder thing to
  believe; but, as nothing is said of an interpreter, I must suppose that
  he had been quietly and painfully taking lessons in this very difficult
  tongue. Anyhow, you must picture him, at some spot not specified,
  addressing a concourse of enthusiastic Revolutionaries. I propose to give
  a brief summary of his speech, from which you will gather that he spoke
  to them like a father, and that, while he showed a cordial sympathy with
  the cause of Russian freedom, he did not hesitate to deliver himself of
  some very straight home-truths.</p>

  <p>"Friends, Russians, Allies," he began; "I come on behalf of my
  fellow-countrymen" (you know his touching way of regarding himself as the
  medium of the best intelligence to be found in the British Empire) "to
  convey their affectionate sympathy with you in your triumph over the
  tyranny of Tsardom. At first we took the natural and hopeful view that
  your Revolution, supported by all that was noblest in all ranks of your
  society, was the result of bitter dissatisfaction with the conduct of the
  War, and with the secret and sinister enemy influences which were at work
  to ruin your chances in the common fight against Kaiserism.</p>

  <p>"Yet it was immediately followed by wholesale desertions from the
  firing-line and a general disintegration of military discipline. It
  seems, then, that we were wrong; for otherwise it would be a curious
  irony that a movement designed for the better conduct of the War should
  produce a complete stagnation on your fighting fronts; or, to look at it
  from another point of view, that a Revolution which owed its success to
  the War, since, in such a war as this, the Army and the nation are one,
  should have, for its immediate consequence, an apparent failure on your
  part to remember the purpose for which the War is being fought.</p>

  <p>"No doubt many motives were at work, and it was perhaps natural that
  in the joy of your new-found freedom you should be tempted to forget the
  conditions that had made it possible, and to regard the War as something
  outside and remote, and its importance as small compared with the
  achievement of internal liberty.</p>

  <p>"Well, we have tried patiently to see things with your eyes, and now
  you in your turn must please make an effort to see them with ours. From
  the first, when we in England took on this War, we recognised that <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> the
  country which was bound to get most good out of it was Russia. For her we
  hoped that it was to be in the fullest sense a War of Liberation. Your
  Allies would win liberty from external menace, but you would also see the
  bonds of internal tyranny broken. The <font class="sc">Tsar</font>, the
  little father of his people, had a chance, such as falls to few, of
  giving to his nation something of the true freedom that we in England
  know.</p>

  <p>"He missed his chance. We will not ask why, but he missed it. Yet by
  other means the War has been for you a War of Liberation, and, if you
  break your pledge to see it through, you do not deserve your freedom. Nay
  more, you run the risk of losing it; or, if, through the steadfastness of
  your sworn Allies, you keep it, then you keep it at the cost of
  sacrificing the friendship and sympathy of all free nations who are
  fighting in the cause of liberty; and, on those terms, your own freedom
  is not worth having.</p>

  <p>"Some of you argue that Russia's pledge to her Allies was an
  Imperialist pledge and that you have the right to ignore it. Have you
  forgotten so soon that the prime cause of Russia's entry into this
  quarrel was that Austria had threatened to crush a free nation, Serbia,
  whose race and faith are yours? Besides, a pledge like that is still a
  pledge, though governments may change. Would you have it so that no
  people, from this time on, shall trust the word of Russia for fear that a
  new <i>régime</i> might repudiate it?</p>

  <p>"We have been patient and made allowances. We know that a great nation
  like yours cannot overthrow an age-long tyranny without being shaken
  through every fibre of its being. Time was needed for you to recover your
  balance and to resume a sane view of your obligations to others than
  yourselves. So we have been patient, and are patient still, though the
  inaction on your Front and your withdrawal from your part in the common
  struggle have made our burden in France far harder to bear.</p>

  <p>"If you fail us, we shall no less fight on, we others. 'We shall march
  prospering&mdash;not through your presence.' We shall fight on till the
  ideals of Kaiserism, your worst enemy, are crushed. America, that great
  Republic that loves peace as passionately as you, will take your place,
  will fill up the gap that you leave in the ranks of those who fight for
  freedom. And we shall fight till we get the true peace that we
  want&mdash;not the peace which some of you have advocated, fraternising
  with the common foe, listening to the specious pleas of those who shirk
  the one test of their honesty when they are asked to revolt against a
  tyranny as least as deadly as that which you have yourselves
  overthrown.</p>

  <p>"But you will not fail us, I know. Your hearts, as a nation, were once
  in this War; heavy as our sacrifices have been, yours have been heavier
  still. Why should you change? Why should the birth of your own freedom be
  the death of your sympathy with the cause of the freedom of the world?
  No, you cannot fail us; you are too great for that.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," Mr. Punch concluded, "if, in speaking from a full heart,
  I have allowed myself an excess of candour. At home they have always been
  very kind and let me have a charter to say just what I think; and I have
  been doing it, without much distinction of persons, for seventy-five
  years and more. If to you, who have been dumb so long, this seems beyond
  belief, permit me to offer you, with sincere affection and regard, a
  visible proof of my privilege in the shape of my</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
